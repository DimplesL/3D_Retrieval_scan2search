As the amount of 3D data is increasing on the Internet, many kinds of 3D retrieval engines are developed. Basic keyword-based retrieval techniques are not always effective, therefore content-based retrieval engines appear. This project focuses on developing a shape-based retrieval system, which provide a "scan to search" solution. The user can scan a object and reconstruct its 3D model with an app "123D", and use the scanned 3D point cloud as an input to retrieve models with similar shape. 

Firstly, the scanned data needs to be pre-processed. Scanned noise will be reduced via a bilateral filter. Then the 3D data will be normalized to a certain scale and rasterized to a voxel grid. Thus high frequency noise is avoided while the shape information is mostly kept. Secondly, the shape information is described by applying a spherical harmonics transformation to 3D data. Spherical harmonics describtor is rotational invariant and noise insensitive. For searching, just compute the spherical harmonics for the input 3D data, and find out the 3D data with minimum distance to the input data. Also, this system provides six candidate models with most relevant describtors, so that to avoid mis-matching. 

To verify and test the system, several test cases are carried out. Rotational invariance are tested first, to verify that spherical harmonics are computed correctly. Noise resistant test is then carried out. The last step is to input a scanned 3D model, and retrive similar models in the database. The results shows candidates with similar shapes. Thus this system is completed.
