Introduction
First and foremost, you should write about the most interesting or important parts of your project. Devote most space and time to this. For example:

 

    What design choices did you have along the way, and why did you make the choices you made?
    What was the most difficult part of the project?
    Why was it difficult?
    How did you overcome the difficulties?
    Did you discover anything novel?
    What did you learn?


Set the scene and problem statement/specification. Provide the motivation for reading this report. Introduce the structure of report (what you will cover in which chapters).
