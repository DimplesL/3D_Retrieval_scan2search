\section{Programming environment}

This ``scan to search'' 3D retrieval system is written in Microsoft Visual C++. The user interface is built with MFC dialog. Several libraries are used for computing: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item OpenMesh (for handling 3D models)
\item OpenGL (for rendering 3D models)
\item ANN (for building kd-tree in the 3D bilateral filter)
\item GSL (for computing the associated Legendre polynomials in spherical harmonics decomposition)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Code}


\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item MeshOperation (.h/.cpp) include the key functions for the retrieval system
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item RotateMesh: rotates the model
    \item AddNoise: adds random noise to the model
    \item NormalizeMesh: normalizes the model
    \item RasterizeMesh: rasterizes the model into voxels 
    \item ComputeSpharm: computes the spherical harmonics descriptors
    \item ComputeDistHist: computes the distance histogram descriptors
    \item BatchTrans: batch transforms the models in the database to descriptors and save them into descriptors database
    \item RetrieveMesh: compares the similarity between current descriptors with all the descriptors in the database
    \item BilateralDenoise: uses bilateral filter for 3D denoising 
    \end{enumerate}
\item OpenGLControl (.h/.cpp) has the whole structure of the system. It links the button calls from the user interface to relevant function. 
\item MeshRetrievalMFCDlg (.h/.cpp) manages the user interface, including the window for demonstrating the 3D model and all the buttons. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data files}

There are five folders for storing the data:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item ``DemoSH'': has the spherical harmonics descriptors of the loaded model. 
\item ``DemoDH'': has the distance histogram descriptors of the loaded model.
\item ``MeshDatabase'': has the 3D models (.stl and .obj format) database 
\item ``MeshSHDatabase'': has the spherical harmonics database
\item ``MeshDHDatabase'': has the distance histogram database
\end{enumerate}
